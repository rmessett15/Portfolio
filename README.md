# Building my portfolio from scratch

# <Creating space on the web for me to showcase my talents>

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to build out a rough outline for my own personal porfolio (I repeat, this is a rough outline-more to be added throughout the bootcamp and after). This space will give me a solid platform to showcase my projects and ability to potential employers and customers alike. This process allowed me to see how much room there is to grow within web development, and also about the power of creating a personal brand. This site will provide an oppertunity for potential future employers, colleagues, and partners as evidence of my tenacity and excitment to continue to grow as a developer, and stands as an example of my best foot forward.

## Features

Features of this page include a nav bar with links that send you to their corresponding information within the web page (ie. to sections 'About Me', my 'Work', and a 'Contact-Me' area. Within the work area, there are images with project numbers above them; when the images are clicked, the site will send users directly to those deployed applications. The contact me section works much the same way as the nav bar; when certain elements are clicked (GitHub, Linkden, amd Twitter) the user will be taken directly to those URLs.
